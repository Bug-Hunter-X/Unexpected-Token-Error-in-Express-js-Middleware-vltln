# Unexpected Token Error in Express.js Middleware

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error in Express.js applications: the unexpected token error arising from improperly defined or placed middleware functions.  The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.

## Problem Description

The issue arises from a misunderstanding of how middleware functions should be structured and integrated into the Express.js application.  Incorrect placement or syntax can lead to unexpected tokens errors during the application startup or when handling requests.

## Solution

The solution involves careful examination of the middleware functions' syntax and ensuring they are correctly placed within the middleware stack. This usually involves checking the function signature to ensure it adheres to the Express.js middleware structure (req, res, next).
